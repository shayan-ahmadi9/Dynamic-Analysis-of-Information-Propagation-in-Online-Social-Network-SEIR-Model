# Dynamic Analysis of Information Propagation in Online Social Network SEIR Model

## Abstract

The main purpose of the present paper is to analyze the SEIR dynamical model of information propagation in online social networks. Existing studies, recognize the behavior of the system over time and under certain circumstances, which does not lead to a deep understanding of the system. Herein, the global dynamics of the system are analyzed by calculating the exact equilibrium points and verifying their stability. The phase diagrams and time responses are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the system for different constant coefficients. Also, by plotting basin of attraction graphs, the stability of each fixed point is further examined. These graphs illustrate how changes in the parameters can affect the system and change the stability of each equilibrium point. Obtained results reveal that the propagation of information highly depends on the system parameters, and by controlling the parameters, the behavior of the system can be controlled.
