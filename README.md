# Dynamic Analysis of Information Propagation in Online Social Network SEIR Model

The main pupose of the mentioned paper is to analyze how a rumor may spread in an online social network. The global dynamics of an online social network system are analyzed by calculating the exact equilibrium points and verifying their stability. The phase diagrams and time responses are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the system with the change in parameters. Also, by plotting basin of attraction graphs, the stability of each fixed point is further examined. These graphs illustrate how changes in the parameters can affect the system and change the stability of each equilibrium point.
